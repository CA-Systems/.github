# 🚀 CA Systems Team

Welcome to the coolest corner of the codebase! We're the team that makes the magic happen with our Discord bot, Roblox handler, and stunning documentation site.

## 👥 Meet the Dream Team

### The Masterminds Behind the Magic

- **Oliver** 🌈
  Pride enthusiast and coding virtuoso. If your code isn't fabulous enough, he'll make sure it has more comments.

- **Felix** ⚡
  Our resident problem-solver who turns coffee into code with alarming efficiency.

- **Zoose** 🤪
  Legend has it he once wrote a function that actually worked... on the third try. We keep him around for comic relief (and because he occasionally writes decent code).

## 🛠️ Our Projects

Because even Zoose needs help remembering how things work:
- Comprehensive guides
- Command list (mostly for Zoose)
